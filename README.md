This bundles a json library (producing and parsing) along with some examples for how to use it. `main.cpp` contains all of the examples along with comments.

## The contents

_json_: all source files

_json/include_: all headers

_io_: helper for file io

## Compiling the examples

Run `make all`, then run the compiled binary with `./a.out`. You should see all of the example output.
